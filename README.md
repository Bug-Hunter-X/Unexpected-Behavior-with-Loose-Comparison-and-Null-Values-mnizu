# Unexpected Behavior with Loose Comparison and Null Values in PHP

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP related to loose comparison and null values.

The `bug.php` file contains code with a potential issue. The solution is provided in `bugSolution.php`.

## Problem

PHP's loose comparison (`==`) can lead to unexpected results when dealing with null values and other data types.  This can cause logic errors that are difficult to track down.

## Solution

The recommended approach is to always use strict comparison (`===`) when checking for null or other specific data types. This ensures that the type and value are both compared for equality, preventing unintentional type coercion.
